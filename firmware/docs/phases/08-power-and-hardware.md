# Phase 08 â€” Hardware Integration & Power

Goal: Solid hardware platform for daily use: power, audio path, inputs, mechanicals.

## Scope
- Battery + charging + power-path
- Headphone detect, pop suppression, volume control
- TouchWheel0/MPR121 sensing tweaks

## Acceptance Criteria
- All-day playback target (est. >12h)
- Clean audio path with minimal noise

## Steps
1. Power budget + regulator choices
2. Audio path validation (PCM5102 + amp)
3. Wheel/touch tuning; debounce and thresholds
4. Enclosure/mechanical fitment
